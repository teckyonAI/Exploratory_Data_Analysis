# Exploratory Data Analysis: Unveiling Insights with Data

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from datasets. It provides a structured approach to understanding and visualizing data.

## Features
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Analyze data distribution, relationships, and trends.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate insightful plots for better understanding of the dataset.
- **Structured Notebook**: A step-by-step Jupyter Notebook for performing EDA.
- **Dataset Included**: The project comes with a sample dataset (`possum.csv`) for practice.
